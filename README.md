## Introduction

This project aims to illustrate the application of design patterns and best practices in real-world scenarios. Each folder contains code examples, explanations, and use cases to help you understand how and when to apply each pattern or principle.

## SOLID Principles

The `SOLID_principles` folder provides code samples, explanations, and anti-patterns for each of the five SOLID principles:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle  
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle  
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle  
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle  
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle  

Each subfolder or file contains:
- A description of the principle
- Example code demonstrating correct usage
- Common pitfalls or anti-patterns

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Browse the folders** to find the principle or pattern you are interested in.
2. **Read the explanations** and study the code examples.
3. **Run the examples** if you'd like to see them in action (see language-specific instructions in each folder).
4. **Experiment** by modifying or extending the examples.
